**Uncover advanced defense techniques to craft secure application programming interfaces**

## What is this book about?
Embark on an API security journey, from understanding API inner workings to exploiting vulnerabilities. This book will teach you how to attack APIs, defend by building robust APIs using secure development techniques, and ensure runtime protection.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore the core elements of APIs and their collaborative role in API development
* Understand the OWASP API Security Top 10, dissecting the root causes of API vulnerabilities
* Obtain insights into high-profile API security breaches with practical examples and in-depth analysis
* Use API attacking techniques adversaries use to attack APIs to enhance your defensive strategies
* Employ shield-right security approaches such as API gateways and firewalls
* Defend against common API vulnerabilities across several frameworks and languages, such as .NET, Python, and Java

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for application security engineers, blue teamers, and security professionals looking forward to building an application security program targeting API security. For red teamers and pentesters, it provides insights into exploiting API vulnerabilities. API developers will benefit understanding, anticipating, and defending against potential threats and attacks on their APIs. While basic knowledge of software and security is required to understand the attack vectors and defensive techniques explained in the book, a thorough understanding of API security is all you need to get started.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
